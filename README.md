# What is CRAZYBILLS? 
CRAZYBILLS is a simple inventory management website for shopkeepers and
pharmacists to manage and restock their store items. This website would have a login
for every shop. The shopkeeper will have to enter the details of a new item every time
he wants to stock it in his shop. while adding the item, he will enter relevant details
which will be stored in the database for retreival. He can add/delete/modify all the
inventory items in his shop. This wesite will also let him search/sort/filter for items that a
particular customer could want and also proceed to checkout and bill generation [right
now we are not considering the payment gateway procedures for this]. The bill
generation will display the customer details along with items that are bought and the
method of payment[cash]. After the bill generation, the inventory of the shop is updated.
in case the shop is running low on a certain item, it will be shown in the ‘restock soon’
tab which will be at the bottom of the home screen at all times.
